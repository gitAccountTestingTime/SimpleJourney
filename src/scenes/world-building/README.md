- `bonding_practice` - Creating empathic links between people
- `blood_magic_covenant_connection` - Direct connection to the kingdom's magical foundation

**Magic System:**

**Three Principles:**
1. Resonance - Sensing life essence frequencies
2. Sacrifice - Power requires personal cost (life force, aging, fatigue)
3. Connection - Binding beings together through shared essence

**Magic Types (by difficulty):**
- Empathic Sensing (Beginner): Feel others' emotions and physical states
- Life Link (Intermediate): Share vitality to heal at cost to yourself
- Battle Bond (Advanced): Synchronize warriors' reflexes and strength
- Soul Oath (Expert): Create unbreakable magical promises
- Covenant Weaving (Master): Bind nations together permanently (Silverwood-only)

**The Cost:**
Using blood magic literally costs years of your life. Silverwoods rarely live past 60 despite noble wealth. Your grandmother aged 5 years from one mass healing. Every spell has consequences.

**The Covenant:**
The magical binding holding Aethermoor together. Without a Silverwood maintaining it, the kingdom will fracture. You can:
- Accept duty as Covenant Keeper (traditional path)
- Reform the Covenant to be consensual (revolutionary but risky)
- Break the Covenant entirely (chaos and freedom)

## Usage in Story Flow

These scenes can be accessed through multiple entry points:

2. **Political Focus** - When prioritizing house alliances
3. **Investigation Focus** - When prioritizing solving parents' murder
4. **Magic Focus** - When prioritizing blood magic mastery
5. **People Focus** - When prioritizing common folk connection

The scenes branch based on player choices and lead to different paths:
- Traditional ruler maintaining the system
- Reformer working within existing structures
- Revolutionary completely rebuilding governance
- Populist building power through common folk

## Thematic Depth

The world-building adds several layers of complexity:

**Moral Ambiguity:**
- Aelindra opposed reforms for principled reasons (safety) not just elitism
- Ironforge's weapons armed both sides
- Crown Breakers were manipulated into murder thinking they fought tyranny
- The Covenant provides unity but through magical compulsion

**Systemic Issues:**
- Individual villains (Ravencrest, Grayson) operate within corrupt systems
- Good intentions (your parents' reforms) had unintended consequences
- Quick fixes (emergency relief) anger powerful interests
- Real change requires addressing interconnected problems

**Personal Stakes:**
- Every companion has trauma tied to kingdom's history
- Your choices affect millions of ordinary people
- Using blood magic costs your literal lifespan
- Justice vs. pragmatism in dealing with conspirators

**Power Dynamics:**
- Noble houses vs. common folk
- Old money vs. new money
- Magical elites vs. mundane majority
- Traditional authority vs. popular sovereignty

## Future Expansion Possibilities

These scenes set up potential for:
- House-specific questlines and diplomacy missions
- Magical research and Covenant experiments
- Investigation leading to confronting each conspirator
- Regional tours with specific local problems
- Companion personal quests tied to their homeland regions
- Civil war or peaceful transition depending on choices
- Multiple ending paths based on coalition built and reforms enacted
