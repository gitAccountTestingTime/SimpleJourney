## Design Philosophy

Real-life challenges serve multiple purposes:
1. **Immersion:** Bridge the gap between narrative and reality
2. **Growth:** Encourage real-world personal development
3. **Meaning:** Make story choices feel more significant and earned
4. **Connection:** Help players embody their characters' journeys
5. **Impact:** Create lasting effects beyond the game session

Challenges are always optional - players can decline or choose alternative story paths. The goal is to enhance engagement, not create barriers to enjoyment.
